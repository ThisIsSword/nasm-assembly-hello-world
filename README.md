# nasmstartup
hello world, in x86_64 assembly(NASM syntax)

to compile(assemble) run the command "make" (look up how to write unix make files for more info) afterwards you will get a main.o object file and a main executable file, to run this main executable run the command "./main" (you will get a "machine_code.lst" file, this is the machine code from our assembly file, feel free to run the command "cat machine_code.lst" to see the machine code from the file)
